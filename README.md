Here is a repository of the necessary files to run the mean-field calculation of void sizes for interacting 1-D particles, as implemented in the associated paper: https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.115.088301


The code can be used to show the unique features of adosorption density for soft interacting particles, as shown in the attached figures:

For further information, or for more detailed instructions on how you might apply this code to a problem of your own, please contact me, and  I would be happy to make it more "user friendly".
